## Overview

This is the Tensorflow2 implementation of paper "Enhancing Privacy and Scalability in Deep Learning-based CSI feedback Autoencoders: A  Novel Approach to Separate Training". 
## Requirements

Our experiment packages version are below:
- Python >= 3.7
- numpy == 1.19.1
- tensorflow >= 2.2.0
- pandas == 1.1.3
- h5py == 2.10.0
- tensorboard == 2.2.1
- scipy == 1.4.1
- Keras == 2.3.1

## Project Preparation

#### A. Data Preparation

The channel state information (CSI) Eigenvectors was generated based on the CDL channel at  UMa scenario, as per the Scenarios and Requirements for AI-enhanced CSI from 3GPP Release 16 discussion. You can acquire our experiment datasets on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_lAMLk_5k1Z8zJQlTr5NRnSD6ACaNRtj?usp=sharing) and [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Ggr6gnsXNwzD4ULbwqCmjA).

## Acknowledgment



Thanks  the Github project members for the open source [Transformer tutorial](https://github.com/datawhalechina/Learn-NLP-with-Transformers), our base model for TransNet is based on their work.
